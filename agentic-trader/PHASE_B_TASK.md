# Phase B — Re-verify, Risk Enforcement, Order Review/Execution, and Logging (Automated Daily Task)

_Part of [FriesTrader](https://github.com/YizhiSong/FriesTrader), Copyright (c) 2026 Yizhi Song, MIT License._

Automated second half of this pipeline (see `README.md`), run every
weekday 8:35am Central (5 min after 9:30am ET open) as a cloud routine.
Performs **Steps 4–7**, consuming candidates from Phase A's
`pending_proposals.jsonl`.

Authorized to place real live orders under a narrow condition (see Step
6's "Live-order gate"). **That authorization must be given explicitly, in
advance, by whoever operates this pipeline — after being warned that an
unattended scheduled task has no human confirmation at the moment of
execution.** Do not add, remove, or loosen any gate condition on your own
judgment.

## Step 0 — Load state (do this first, every run)

1. Read `risk_rules.json` **fresh** — never cache across runs. Use its
   `account_number`, not a hardcoded value.
2. Determine today's day of week mechanically (e.g.
   `TZ='America/Chicago' date +'%A'`) — don't infer it from the date
   string. Needed for Step 4's weekend-gap check.
3. Read `pending_proposals.jsonl` (overwritten each Phase A run, holds only
   the latest run — use its `"stage": "thesis"` entries directly as
   today's candidates). If missing or empty, log a `cycle_summary` noting
   nothing to process and stop — don't error.
4. Read `trade_log.jsonl` (if present):
   - **Idempotency — key off the proposal's own `date`, not today's.**
     Skip a candidate if `trade_log.jsonl` already has a `risk_check`/
     `order` entry for that symbol with a matching `proposal_date` (not
     the entry's top-level `date`, which reflects when the decision was
     made and changes daily even for a stale proposal). This matters
     because if Phase A ever fails to run, an un-refreshed proposal would
     otherwise look "new" every day and could be re-bought repeatedly;
     keying off `proposal_date` means it's decided once. `stop_loss`/
     `take_profit` are exempt — always run fresh.
   - **Dry-run cycle count**: number of **distinct dates** with a
     `cycle_summary` entry where `mode: dry_run` — not raw entry count
     (same-day reruns count once). This represents validated days, not
     executions, and must be
     `>= execution.dry_run_min_cycles_before_live` before Step 6's
     live-order gate can open.

## Step 4 — Re-verify proposals against fresh opening data

**Resolve sells and classify candidates (do this first):**
1. Run Step 5's stop-loss and take-profit checks now (pull
   `get_equity_positions` and fresh quotes, resolve any triggered sells) —
   needed before knowing current slot occupancy.
2. Process any `direction: "exit_existing"` candidates now too (through
   the staleness check below, then to Step 6 as a sell) — selling is
   never gated.
3. Split remaining `direction: "long"` candidates:
   - **new**: not a live open position — a genuine new entry, the only
     kind that consumes a slot.
   - **held**: already a live open position — a potential top-up (Step 5).
     Top-ups never consume a slot and are always considered regardless of
     account fullness.
4. `open_slots = max_concurrent_positions - (live positions per
   get_equity_positions, excluding sells just resolved)`. Only **new**
   candidates consume a slot; fixed for the cycle unless one gets
   approved in Step 5.
5. **If `open_slots <= 0`**: no **new** candidate can be approved this
   cycle. Skip the weekend-gap search, staleness check, and Step 5 work
   for every **new**-group candidate — log instead:
   `"stage": "risk_check", "passed": false, "proposal_date": "<candidate's date from pending_proposals.jsonl>", "reason": "no open slots this cycle (X of Y max already held/approved) — skipped without staleness re-check"`.
   **held** group is unaffected.
6. **If `open_slots > 0`**: **new** group continues normally (slots may
   still run out mid-Step-5 via ordinary per-candidate concurrency check).

For every **new** candidate not short-circuited by 5, and every **held**
candidate (always):

### Weekend gap (Monday runs only)

A Friday proposal is staler than an overnight one — 2.5 days vs ~16
hours. **If today is Monday**:

1. Before the price-staleness check, run **one additional targeted search
   per pending proposal** covering Saturday/Sunday (earnings, M&A,
   guidance, macro) — separate from and not counted against
   `cadence.news_search_budget_per_cycle`. Same sourcing rules as Phase
   A's thesis `sources` field (prefer primary/major-outlet sources; cite
   whatever you used).
2. If anything materially contradicts the thesis/invalidation criteria,
   drop it — log
   `"stage": "risk_check", "passed": false, "proposal_date": "<candidate's date from pending_proposals.jsonl>", "reason": "weekend news invalidated thesis: <what you found>", "sources": ["Outlet Name: https://..."]`
   — don't process further.
3. If nothing turns up, proceed to the price-based check.

Other weekdays: skip straight to the price-based check.

### Price-based staleness check (every day)

Pull a fresh quote (`get_equity_quotes`) — re-verify against this
morning's open, not Phase A's prior-close price. If the price gapped
significantly, re-check against the thesis's `invalidation` criteria —
same sourcing rules as above, cite whatever explains the gap in a
`"sources"` field on the resulting log line; if the gap plausibly
invalidates it, drop it as above.

## Step 5 — Mechanical risk enforcement

**Stop-loss check (always runs, independent of new candidates):** Pull
current `get_equity_positions` and fresh `get_equity_quotes` for every
open position.

**Gather inputs, then let the script decide — do not hand-compute the
reference price, drawdown, stdev, or clamp.** For each position:
- Check `trade_log.jsonl` for whether any `take_profit` tier has fired
  for this position's current holding period (same "since quantity
  last reached zero" scope as the take-profit check below).
- If a tier has fired, pull daily `high_price` bars via
  `get_equity_historicals` (interval=day, split-adjusted) from the
  holding period's entry date (the buy that started it from zero)
  through yesterday, for `--daily-highs`.
- If `risk_rules.json`'s `stop_loss.mode` is `"volatility_scaled"` and
  the position is not currently showing a gain on average cost, pull
  the last `stop_loss.volatility_lookback_trading_days` trading days
  of daily closes via `get_equity_historicals` (interval=day,
  split-adjusted; request ~30 calendar days back to cover
  weekends/holidays, drop any `interpolated: true` bars), oldest
  first through yesterday, for `--daily-closes`. Skip this pull on a
  gain — the script itself also skips the computation in that case,
  since a non-positive drawdown can never meet a positive `stop_pct`.

Run:
`python3 scripts/stop_loss.py --average-cost <avg cost> --current-price <fresh quote> --mode <stop_loss.mode> --hard-stop-pct <stop_loss.hard_stop_pct> --volatility-multiplier <stop_loss.volatility_stdev_multiplier> --min-stop-pct <stop_loss.min_stop_pct> --max-stop-pct <stop_loss.max_stop_pct> --fallback-stop-pct <stop_loss.fallback_stop_pct> --min-bars 10 [--daily-closes <comma-separated closes>] [--take-profit-tier-fired --daily-highs <comma-separated highs> --trailing-high-since <entry date>]`
and use its JSON output directly (`stop_reference_basis`,
`stop_reference_price`, `drawdown_pct`, `stop_pct_used`, `stdev_20d`
when computed, `fallback_reason` when the fallback applied,
`triggered`, `action`) rather than recomputing any of it. This only
changes what the stop protects — it does not affect the take-profit
gain calculation below, which always measures gain from average cost
regardless of `stop_reference_basis`.

**If the script fails to run**, do not guess a result: treat this
position as if a loss-limit breach applied this cycle (`entries_halted
= true` for new entries/top-ups, this position itself excluded from
any sell decision) and log `"stage": "stop_loss"` with
`"stop_pct_used": null, "triggered": false, "action":
"halt_entries_check_manually", "notes": "stop_loss.py failed to run —
verify this position's stop manually before next cycle"`. Do not fall
back to manual computation.

If `triggered` is true: immediate full-position sell — no thesis
review, never blocked by a loss-limit halt. Log `"stage": "stop_loss"`
with the script's `stop_pct_used`, `stop_reference_basis`, and
`stop_reference_price` (plus, when trailing, `trailing_high_since`);
when `stop_pct_used` is null, log the script's own `"notes": "gain,
stop not computed"` as-is. Include `stdev_20d`/`fallback_reason` when
present. If triggered, treat as a Step 6 sell candidate. A good thesis
never cancels a stop-loss — see `risk_rules.json`'s note.

**Take-profit check (always runs, independent of new candidates, tiered
partial sells)**: Using the same pull as the stop-loss check (no need to
call again — average cost, quantity, and fresh price as they stood at
the start of Step 5, before any of this cycle's sells execute in Step
6), check `trade_log.jsonl` for `"stage": "take_profit"` entries for
this symbol, logged since the position's quantity last reached zero (a
full exit) — collect the `tier_id` values already fired this holding
period.

**Match fired tiers on `tier_id`, never on `gain_pct`.** A tier's
`gain_pct` is a threshold you may retune at any time; its `id` is its
permanent identity. Matching on the value means retuning a tier (say
`0.15` → `0.18`) makes an already-fired tier look unfired against a
position still held, firing it a second time and selling another
`sell_fraction_of_position` of it for no reason. If a `take_profit`
entry from an older holding period predates tier ids entirely, that
holding period is closed and its entries are out of scope by the
"since quantity last reached zero" rule.

Run:
`python3 scripts/take_profit.py --average-cost <avg cost> --current-price <fresh quote> --quantity <quantity> --tiers <risk_rules.json take_profit.tiers as "id:gain_pct:sell_fraction" triples, e.g. "tp1:0.15:0.25,tp2:0.30:0.25,tp3:0.50:0.25"> [--already-fired <comma-separated tier IDs already fired this holding period, e.g. "tp1,tp2">]`
and use its JSON output directly (`gain_pct`, `tiers_status`,
`fired_this_cycle`, `triggered`, `action`) rather than recomputing any
of it — the script already handles the ascending-order,
cascading-quantity logic for **when a single cycle's gain has jumped
past more than one not-yet-fired tier at once**.

**If the script fails to run**, treat it like a stop-loss script
failure: `entries_halted = true` for new entries/top-ups this cycle,
exclude this position from any sell decision, and log `"stage":
"take_profit"` with `"triggered": false, "action":
"halt_entries_check_manually", "notes": "take_profit.py failed to run
— verify this position's tiers manually before next cycle"`. Do not
fall back to manual computation.

If `fired_this_cycle` is non-empty: log one line per entry in it
(already in ascending order) — `"stage": "take_profit",
"tier_id"`, `"tier_gain_pct"`, `"sell_fraction"`, `"quantity_before"`,
`"quantity_sold"` straight from that entry, plus the script's
top-level `"gain_pct"` and `"tiers_status"`, `"triggered": true,
"action": "sell_partial_position"` — and treat each as its own Step 6
sell candidate. **`tier_id` on that line is load-bearing**: it is what
the next cycle's `--already-fired` lookup reads to know this tier is
spent. A `take_profit` line logged without it leaves the tier
indistinguishable from an unfired one. No thesis review, never blocked by a loss-limit halt
(it's an exit, not a new entry). If `fired_this_cycle` is empty, log
one line with the script's `gain_pct` and `tiers_status`, `"triggered":
false, "action": "hold_monitor"`. Once all three tiers have fired, the
remaining quantity is held long indefinitely — only the stop-loss
check above still applies to it. Tiers become eligible again only
after the position is fully closed to zero shares and a new entry is
later opened (a genuinely new holding period, not a top-up).

**No same-cycle sell-then-buy**: if a symbol's stop-loss fired or any
take-profit tier fired earlier in this same cycle, it is not eligible
for a top-up this same cycle, regardless of thesis or conviction — drop
it from the **held** group before the merged priority order below,
logging
`"stage": "risk_check", "passed": false, "position_action": "top_up", "reason": "stop-loss/take-profit fired this cycle — not eligible for a same-cycle top-up"`.
This applies unconditionally (dry_run or live) since it's about not
producing a self-contradictory sell-and-buy decision within one cycle,
not about whether the sell actually executed. It's a normal top-up
candidate again starting next cycle (subject to the sell re-entry lock
below).

**Sell re-entry lock — price-gated, not time-gated, any sell type**:
check `trade_log.jsonl` for this symbol's most recent `"stage": "order"`
entry whose `reason` is any sell (`stop_loss`, `take_profit`, or
`exit_existing`). This lock only applies if that sell actually
executed — confirm via `get_equity_positions` that its quantity is
genuinely lower than it was immediately before that logged sell (or the
position was fully closed and re-opened since). A `dry_run` sell entry
never actually reduces the position, so if `get_equity_positions` still
shows the same (or higher) quantity as before that logged sell, there
was no real reduction from it and the lock does not apply — the symbol
should be evaluated normally (e.g. a top-up), not dropped. When the sell
did actually execute and no later `order` entry for that symbol shows a
buy since, the symbol is locked out of any new buy (new entry or
top-up) — including later in this same cycle — until a fresh quote is
**at or below** the price it was sold at (that entry's `quote_bid`), no
matter how many cycles or days have passed, and regardless of thesis
quality or conviction. This exists to prevent buying back into a symbol
at a worse price than you just sold it at, whatever the reason for that
sell — averaging up right after trimming or exiting undermines the
whole point of it. Before ranking, pull a fresh quote for any candidate
with an unresolved (actually-executed) sell lock and drop it from the
merged priority order below if the fresh price is above that sell
price — log it as its own line rather than silently omitting it:
`"stage": "risk_check", "passed": false, "proposal_date": "<candidate's date from pending_proposals.jsonl>", "reason": "sell re-entry lock — current price <X> is above the <Y> it was sold at on <date> (reason: <stop_loss|take_profit|exit_existing>)"`.
Once the fresh price is at or below that sell price, the lock clears and
it's eligible again as a normal candidate through Phase A's usual
screening — no separate time-based cooldown on top of this.

**Wash-sale guard (buys only) — cross-account, calendar-gated, separate
from the price-gated lock above:** if `risk_rules.json`'s
`wash_sale_avoidance.enabled` is `false`, skip this guard entirely and
proceed as if it doesn't exist. If `true`: before approving any
**new**-group or **held**-group (top-up) candidate, check every account
number in `wash_sale_avoidance.linked_accounts` (not just this account)
for a closing sale of that symbol realizing a loss within the last
`lookback_window_days` days — call `get_pnl_trade_history` per linked
account, filtered to the symbol, and look for any closing trade with a
negative realized gain dated inside the window. This is independent of
and in addition to the sell re-entry lock above: that lock is
price-gated and scoped to this account only; this guard is
calendar-gated and spans every linked account, because the IRS
wash-sale rule applies per taxpayer across all accounts a person
controls, not per account and not per price. If a matching loss sale
turns up in **any** linked account, drop the candidate before ranking —
log
`"stage": "risk_check", "passed": false, "reason": "wash sale guard -- <symbol> was sold at a loss in account <account_number> on <date>, within the <lookback_window_days>-day wash-sale window"`
(add `"position_action": "top_up"` if it's a top-up candidate). This
guard never applies to stop_loss/take_profit/exit_existing sells —
selling is never gated by tax considerations, only buying is (see the
flag-only check just below for the sell side).

**Wash-sale flag on sells (informational only, never blocks a sell):**
whenever the stop-loss check triggers, a take-profit tier fires, or an
`exit_existing` sell is processed, and that specific sale realizes a
loss (a stop-loss sell is always a loss by definition; check
take-profit/`exit_existing` case by case against the fill), check the
same `wash_sale_avoidance.linked_accounts` for a purchase of that symbol
within `lookback_window_days` days before today.

A qualifying purchase alone is not enough to flag — the wash-sale rule
disallows the loss by rolling it into the cost basis of stock you still
hold, so if nothing of that symbol remains held anywhere after this
sale, there is no replacement position for a disallowed loss to attach
to and it is not a wash sale, whatever the calendar gap. Concretely: a
single purchase fully closed out by this same sale (that account's
position in the symbol is now zero, and no other linked account holds
or separately purchased the symbol within the window) is an ordinary
closed round-trip, not a wash sale — do not flag it. Before adding the
flag, call `get_equity_positions` for every account in
`wash_sale_avoidance.linked_accounts` and confirm at least one of them
still holds a nonzero quantity of the symbol after this sale, sourced
from a purchase inside the lookback window (i.e. a genuine surviving
replacement lot, not the shares this sale just closed out). Only then
add
`"wash_sale_flag": true, "wash_sale_note": "possible wash sale -- <symbol> was bought in account <account_number> on <date>, within <lookback_window_days> days of this sale, and a replacement position remains held in account <holding_account_number> -- this loss may be disallowed (or, if <holding_account_number> is an IRA, permanently disallowed) for tax purposes"`
to that sell's `order` log entry. Purely informational for the human's
own tax reconciliation — it never blocks, delays, or resizes the sell
itself, and it does not require `wash_sale_avoidance.enabled` to be
`true` (the flag is a record of what happened, not a guard against
future action, so it stays on even if the buy-side guard is toggled
off). Note the asymmetry this can't fix: a sell logged clean today can
still become a wash sale later if a linked account buys the same symbol
afterward — that's outside this pipeline's visibility and control.

**Loss-limit halt check (always runs, gates all new entries and top-ups):**
Call `get_realized_pnl` span=day and span=week (asset_classes=[equity])
for today's and this week's realized `total_returns` in dollars (0 if no
trades). Do **not** hand-compute the percentages — run
`python3 scripts/pnl_pct.py --daily-realized-usd <day total_returns> --weekly-realized-usd <week total_returns> --starting-capital-usd <risk_rules.json starting_capital_usd> --daily-limit-pct <loss_limits.daily_loss_limit_pct_of_account> --weekly-limit-pct <loss_limits.weekly_loss_limit_pct_of_account>`
and use its JSON output (`daily_pnl_pct`, `weekly_pnl_pct`,
`entries_halted`, `halt_reason`) directly. **If the script fails to run
or `get_realized_pnl` can't be determined cleanly, fail safe: treat as
breached** (`entries_halted = true`) rather than falling back to manual
computation. Halts both new entries and top-ups (a top-up still spends
cash/exposure, even though it skips the concurrency check).
Log as `"stage": "loss_limit_check"`.

**Candidate priority order — new entries and top-ups compete equally
(decide before any per-candidate check):**
Merge **new** and **held** groups from Step 4 (excluding new-group
candidates already rejected by Step 4's capacity short-circuit) into
one list. **Do not hand-sort or hand-compute any of this — gather the
inputs below and let the scripts decide.**

**Gather, for every candidate in the merged list:** `symbol`,
`conviction`, `risk_flags` (omit the key entirely if the thesis
disclosed none — an omitted key and an empty array mean different
things to the ranking script below), `pct_below_52wk_high` (omit if
not available), `group` (`"new"` or `"held"`), and — for **held**
candidates only — `current_position_value` (quantity from
`get_equity_positions` × fresh price from `get_equity_quotes`). Also
gather live `total_value` and `cash` from `get_portfolio` (`cash` is
the starting `cash_remaining`), and `concurrent_positions_start` (the
live open position count per Step 4's `open_slots` calc, before this
cycle's approvals).

Rank the candidates, then size them — pipe the candidate list (a JSON
array) through both scripts in sequence (directly chainable):
`python3 scripts/rank_candidates.py | python3 scripts/position_sizing.py --total-value <total_value> --cash-start <cash> --concurrent-positions-start <concurrent_positions_start> [--entries-halted] --max-position-pct <position_sizing.max_position_pct_of_account> --max-concurrent-positions <position_sizing.max_concurrent_positions> --min-cash-buffer-pct <position_sizing.min_cash_buffer_pct> --min-top-up-usd <position_sizing.min_top_up_usd> --min-top-up-pct-of-target <position_sizing.min_top_up_pct_of_target> --conviction-pct <position_sizing.conviction_pct_of_account as "tier:pct" pairs, e.g. "high:0.20,medium:0.12,low:0.06">`

**Build `--conviction-pct` from `risk_rules.json`'s
`position_sizing.conviction_pct_of_account`, never from a value typed
into this file or a routine prompt.** It sets how much of the account
each conviction tier is worth, which makes it a risk limit like any
other, and `risk_rules.json` is the one place those are auditable.
`position_sizing.py` rejects the whole cycle if any tier there exceeds
`max_position_pct_of_account`.
`rank_candidates.py` sorts by conviction tier first (`high` before
`medium` before `low`), then `risk_flags` count ascending within a
tier (a missing `risk_flags` field sorts last, treated as worst
case), then `pct_below_52wk_high` descending (a missing field sorts
last in its tier) — a high-conviction top-up can end up ranked ahead
of a lower-conviction new entry and vice versa.
`position_sizing.py` then processes strictly in that ranked order,
compounding the running cash/concurrency totals as each candidate is
approved. Pass `--entries-halted` whenever the loss-limit check above
(or a stop-loss/take-profit script failure) halted entries this cycle
— the sizing script then rejects every candidate uniformly with the
standard halt reason and leaves the totals unchanged.

**Log `risk_flags` and `pct_below_52wk_high` as structured fields on
every risk_check entry from this sort — winners and rejections alike**
(the only place this survives, since `pending_proposals.jsonl` is
overwritten daily).

Use the final script's JSON output directly — its `results` array (one
entry per candidate, in ranked order, each carrying `passed`, and
depending on outcome: `reason`, `position_action: "top_up"`,
`dollar_amount`, `current_position_value`, `target_size`, `headroom`,
`concurrent_positions_after`, `cash_remaining_after`,
`cash_buffer_after_pct`) plus `cash_remaining_final` and
`concurrent_positions_after_final` — rather than recomputing any of
it. A **new**-group candidate rejected purely for lack of slots
carries the script's own `"concurrent_positions_after (N) exceeds
max_concurrent_positions (M) — cap filled by higher-priority
candidates this cycle"` wording, to show it's scarcity, not quality.

**If either script fails to run**, do not guess a result: reject every
still-pending candidate this cycle — log `"stage": "risk_check",
"passed": false, "reason": "rank_candidates.py/position_sizing.py
failed to run — no orders attempted this cycle, verify manually"` for
each — rather than falling back to manual computation.

For each candidate, log `"stage": "risk_check"` with that candidate's
`results` entry fields verbatim.

Every `risk_check` entry must include `proposal_date` (copied from the
candidate's `"date"` in `pending_proposals.jsonl` — Step 0's idempotency
key) and, for `direction: "long"`, `risk_flags` and `pct_below_52wk_high`
(for auditing the priority sort). Top-up entries must also include
`"position_action": "top_up"`.

`direction: "avoid"` candidates aren't processed further (already logged
in Phase A). `direction: "exit_existing"` candidates for a held symbol
skip all the checks above (selling reduces risk — not blocked by
position/concurrency/cash-buffer/loss-limit checks) and go straight to
Step 6 as a sell.

## Step 6 — Dry run before anything live (order review and the live-order gate)

For every candidate that passed Step 5 (stop-loss, take-profit,
exit_existing sells, and approved top-ups):

1. **Always** call `review_equity_order` first — a preview, never places
   anything.
2. If it surfaces a blocking alert, do not proceed to placement regardless
   of mode; log the alert verbatim and treat as rejected.
3. Otherwise, branch on `execution.mode` (fresh from Step 0) and the
   dry-run cycle count:

   **Live-order gate — ALL must be true:**
   - `execution.mode == "live"`
   - dry-run cycle count `>= execution.dry_run_min_cycles_before_live`
   - `review_equity_order` for this order returned no blocking alert

   - **Gate open**: call `place_equity_order` with the reviewed
     parameters. Then confirm the real fill before logging — the
     `place_equity_order` response alone is not enough (it typically
     returns `order_state: "unconfirmed"`, not the actual outcome):
     1. Call `get_equity_orders` with this `order_id`.
     2. If `state` is terminal (`filled`, `partially_filled`,
        `cancelled`, `rejected`, `failed`, `voided`), use it.
     3. Otherwise wait ~15 seconds and check once more; use whatever
        `state` comes back, terminal or not — never poll more than
        twice or block the cycle waiting for a fill.
     Log `"stage": "order", "mode": "live", "placed": true, "order_id":
     "<id>", "order_state": "<confirmed state from get_equity_orders>",
     "fill_price": <average_price if filled/partially_filled, else
     null>, "fill_quantity": <cumulative_quantity if filled/partially_filled,
     else null>` in addition to the pre-trade `quote_ask`/`quantity`
     estimate already logged (not in place of it) — the log should show
     both the estimate and the confirmed real outcome.
   - `execution.mode == "dry_run"`: log
     `"stage": "order", "mode": "dry_run", "would_execute": true"` and stop.
     **Never call `place_equity_order` here.**
   - `execution.mode == "live"` but cycle count still under threshold: do
     **not** place. Log
     `"stage": "order", "mode": "live_blocked_insufficient_cycles", "would_execute": true, "placed": false"`
     with current vs. required count.

Never change `execution.mode` yourself. Never invent/guess a field value —
if a tool call fails, log the failure and skip that candidate. Every
`order` entry must carry `proposal_date` (same as Step 5) — Step 0's
idempotency check matches against either a `risk_check` or `order` entry.

## Step 7 — Logging

Append every decision to `trade_log.jsonl` — one JSON line each:
`stop_loss`, `take_profit`, `loss_limit_check`, `risk_check` (pass/fail,
including Step 4's weekend-gap/price-gap rejections and Step 5's top-up
evaluations), and `order` stages, matching the shape already in
`trade_log.jsonl`/`trade_log_template.jsonl`. Top-up entries must include
`"position_action": "top_up"`.

**Every line — including the final `cycle_summary` — needs a real
`"timestamp"`** (`HH:mm:ss`, e.g. via `TZ='America/Chicago' date +'%H:%M:%S'`
— never guessed), no date prefix. Separate from `"date"`/`"proposal_date"`
— for readability only, never used for idempotency, dry-run count, or
other logic; only `date` and `proposal_date` are mechanical.

**Always append exactly one final line per run**, even if nothing else
happened:
```json
{"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "timestamp": "HH:mm:ss", "stage": "cycle_summary", "mode": "dry_run|live", "candidates_considered": N, "orders_reviewed": N, "orders_placed": N}
```
Load-bearing — Step 0's dry-run cycle count depends on this line existing
every run, keyed off `"date"` (distinct dates), not `"timestamp"`.

**After appending, regenerate `trade_log_recent.md`** (full overwrite,
not append) — a short, plain-English recap of today's cycle for a quick
mobile/GitHub read, not another machine format. A `# YYYY-MM-DD`
heading, then prose/bullet sections covering only what actually
happened this cycle (skip anything empty): the loss-limit check result;
each held position's stop-loss/take-profit status (symbol, `stop_pct`
used, gain/drawdown, and whether it triggered, fired a tier, sold, or
is just holding); each new-entry/top-up candidate considered and its
outcome in one line (approved and sized, or rejected and why); and any
orders actually placed (symbol, buy/sell, dollar amount). This is a
readable render of what this cycle already decided — no new research,
no re-deciding anything. Convenience view only, not a second audit
trail: `trade_log.jsonl` is still the source of truth, and if the two
ever disagree, trust `trade_log.jsonl`.

## Hard rules

- Never change `execution.mode` or any `risk_rules.json` value.
- Never call `place_equity_order` unless Step 6's live-order gate is open
  at that moment.
- A "high conviction" thesis never overrides a failed mechanical check.
- If required data can't be retrieved (portfolio, positions, P&L history),
  fail safe — treat the check as failed/halt new entries — and log exactly
  what failed.
- The wash-sale guard (Step 5) only ever blocks a buy. It must never
  block, delay, or resize a stop_loss/take_profit/exit_existing sell —
  a tax outcome never overrides risk management.
